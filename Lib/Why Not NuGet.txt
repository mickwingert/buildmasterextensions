"Why do you have a /lib folder instead of using NuGet?"

Although NuGet is becoming the mainstream dependency manager for .NET, it's 
not mainstream yet, especially for corporate/enterprise environments. We
wanted to make this starter project as accessible as possible.

To convert this project to use NuGet, simply delete the lib folder, delete
the project references, and then add the BuildMasterSDK package from NuGet.

P.S. Did you know we have a pretty cool private NuGet server/repository 
     called ProGet? Check it out at http://inedo.com/proget
